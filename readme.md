# The Forgotton Adventures of Kroz

## Introduction

This is a text adventure game that is a tribute to the original Kroz series of games. The original Kroz games were created by Scott Miller and published by Apogee Software. The original Kroz games were released in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is an unofficial rewrite/remix of the original Kroz games in JavaScript (TypeScript).

The goal is mimic the original Kroz games, while proving a framework for new features and improvements. This version of Kroz is written in JavaScript (TypeScript) and uses the ROT.js library for the game engine using the [original Kroz source code](https://github.com/tangentforks/kroz) as a reference.
